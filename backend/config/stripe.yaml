# Stripe Configuration
# This file is used for local development only
# In production/Docker builds, this file is regenerated with build-time secrets
# The webhook secret is used to verify that webhook events are actually sent from Stripe
# In development, this can be obtained from the Stripe CLI
# In production, this should be set from your webhook endpoint configuration

# Leave these empty - they will be populated from environment variables (.env file)

# Mail Configuration
# This file is used for local development only
# In production/Docker builds, this file is regenerated with build-time secrets
# 
# For Gmail SMTP:
# - Use smtp.gmail.com as the server
# - Use port 587 for TLS
# - Use your Gmail address as username
# - Use an App Password (not your regular password) for password
#   To generate an App Password:
#   1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Google account
#   2. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
#   3. Generate a new app password for "Mail"
#   4. Use this 16-character password here

# Leave these empty - they will be populated from environment variables (.env file)
